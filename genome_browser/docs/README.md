title: Human brain region-specific variably methylated regions (VMRs) are enriched for heritability of distinct neuropsychiatric traits
---

## Description

These tracks show results from genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation data from 182 GTEx samples spanning 8 brain regions and two non-brain tissues. 

We performed:

- **W**hole **G**enome **B**isulfite **S**equencing (WGBS, n = 182)

Data come from NeuN+ nuclei (neurons) sorted from 8 brain regions:

- Prefrontal cortex (BA9)
- Anterior cingulate cortex (BA24)
- Hippocampus
- Nucleus accumbens (basal ganglia)
- Caudate (basal ganglia)
- Putamen (basal ganglia)
- Amygdala
- Hypothalamus

and 2 bulk (not sorted) non-brain tissues:

- Lung 
- Thyroid

## Methods

Methods are described in:

- [**W**hole **G**enome **B**isulfite **S**equencing (WGBS)](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/egtex_brain_wgbs/hg38/docs/WGBS.html)

## Caveats

Methylation and coverage tracks do not incorporate biological variability. 
Visually inferring regions of differential methylation, differential accessibility, or differential expression from these tracks alone is not recommended.
Instead, information across all samples should be used to identify these regions and analysed with statistical methods that account for biological variability (see 'Data Access', below). 

## Data Access

Raw data generated during this study will be made available as part of GTEx v9 release on dbGaP upon publication. Processed data generated during this study will be made available through the GTEx Portal upon publication. 
We recommend that these data are used for any downstream statistical analyses.
