================
Analysis of differential DNA methylation and variability in neuronal nuclei isolated from 8 diverse brain regions. Variability analyses were also performed in two somatic tissues (lung, thyroid) to identify regions of common variation shared among diverse tissues.

Data comprises 182 samples. Nuclei from the brain tissues were
    flow sorted based on positive NeuN staining.

| Tissue                                    | Sorted |  n |
